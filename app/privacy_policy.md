# Privacy Policy

----------------------------

Last updated August 4th, 2021

This privacy policy describes our policies and procedures on collection, use and disclosure of your information when you use this service. We collect data in order to improve our site and decide where to allocate resources. By using this service, you agree to the collection and use of this information in accordance with this privacy policy.

## Definitions

----------------------------

 - **Personal Information** is any information that could be used to identify an individual. It does not include information that is encoded or anonymized, or publicly available information that has not been combined with non-public information.
 - **Cookies** are small files that are placed on your device by a website, containing the details of your browsing history and other information that may be used for site functionality, amongst other uses.
 - **Web Beacons** are invisible images sent to your browser to see if a user has accessed some content.
 - **IPv4 Address** is a unique identification number associated with your device when accessing the internet. It is made of four numbers, each ranging from zero to two hundred and fifty five.
 
## Information we collect and how it is used

----------------------------

CovidEye does not make money from advertisements, so we do not sell your information to advertisers. We take great effort to make sure your data is as anonymous and well protected as we can.

In order to measure site popularity and usage, and to improve the functionality of our site, we collect and track information from your interactions with our site. Some of this information is actively given to us (e.g. location) while others are collected automatically (e.g. web browsers and site access time).

### Information we collect includes:

 - Your geographical location. On loading the site we request permission to view your location, solely to display it as a pin on the map. This data **is not stored** in a permanent way. If you do not wish to provide your location to display on the map, please have your web-browser deny the request.
 - Your *Anonymized* IPv4 address. The first half of your IP address is tracked in order to help assess our number of new, active or previous users. Because only half is stored, this is not considered identifiable information.
 - Metadata about your device. This may include your device's browser, operating system and screen resolution. We use this information to differentiate new versus existing users.
 - Your interactions with the site. This includes clicking buttons and time spent on the site. We use this information to assess which tools on the site are more popular or useful, in order to focus development and performance improvements on those features.
 - Site referrers. We use special links to determine how our audience discovers our website in an anonymous way.

### Information we do not collect:

 - Cookies
 - Web Beacons

## How our data is processed and stored

----------------------------

All tracking data is sent directly to the same server the website is running on. We use a private, US based server with the latest encryption standards available, ensuring your data is never leaked to any third parties. All our tracking data processing is done with [Matomo](https://matomo.org/), an open source analytics platform designed with your privacy in mind. Finally, data is stored on a secure database in the same server, which only our Project Manager has access to.

We do not use third party data tracking services because we respect your privacy and rights.

## Further Concerns

----------------------------

### Opt Out

For our users who wish to not partake in our tracking, please either enable "do-not-track" requests in your browser. Because our site does not use cookies, we cannot simply have an "Opt-out" button. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

### Review our Work

Because this project is open source, licensed under the GNU GPLv3.0, you may view our tracking code for yourself on our [Github](https://github.com/KGB-8375/covideye/blob/main/app/www/matomo.js)
