----------------------------

CovidEye is a free and open source site to see COVID-19 related data in Virginia.

This project was created by volunteer college students as an entry for the [IEEE Pandemic Challenge](https://r3.ieee.org/richmond/covid/covid-problems/). Our goal was to present public information in the most visual and simple way we could, while still providing the detail and clarity available on other websites.

For more details on how the site works, check out our [GitHub Page](https://github.com/KGB-8375/covideye) where you can read about our implementation and browse our code.
