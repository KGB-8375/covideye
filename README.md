# IEEE Richmond Pandemic Challenge (2021)
## Choropleth Data Tracking
Team drumroll please's github repository for RVA CovidView

## Description of Challenge

Despite efforts from the Virginia Department of Health (VDH), data for tracking the COVID-19 virus throughout Virginia
is difficult and cryptic for the average person. Even with visual elements such as choropleths (multicolored maps representing
case numbers), trends such as change in daily cases largely remains hidden. Furthermore, due to poor choices in color schemes,
the color difference between a couple thousand cases looks the same as several thousand cases. Our task is to create a new interface
that is more accessable, easier to understand, and makes the data more clear and easily understood by average people.

## Our Team

Our team *Drumroll Please* is made up of three undergrad students in the Henrico area:

 - Nathan Rowan (VCU)
 - Yaqub Mukhtar (VCU)
 - Duncan Fernandez (Reynolds)

## Our solution path

Our project is still very early in development, however we plan on making an interactive web app using the R programming language's
`shiny` package, incorperating interactive elements such as [choropleths](https://kgb-8375.github.io/ieee-challenge-choropleth/choropleth.html)
to visualize an up-to-date data feed from the [Virginia Department of Health](https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/).
