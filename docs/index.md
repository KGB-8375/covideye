# 2021 VA IEEE Covid Challenge
## Choropleth Data Tracking
Team drumroll please's github repository for VA IEEE Covid Challenge 2021

## Description of Challenge:

Despite efforts from the Virginia Department of Health (VDH), data for tracking the COVID-19 virus throughout Virginia
is difficult and cryptic for the average person. Even with visual elements such as choropleths (multicolored maps representing
case numbers), trends such as change in daily cases largely remains hidden. Furthermore, due to poor choices in color schemes,
the color difference between a couple thousand cases looks the same as several thousand cases. Our task is to create a new interface
that is more accessable, easier to understand, and makes the data more clear and easily understood by average people.

## Our solution path:

Our project is still very early in development, however we plan on making an interactive webpage using the R programming language.
